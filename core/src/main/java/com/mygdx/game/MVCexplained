The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates application functionality into
three kinds of components:

- A model, which contains the applicationâ€™s data

- A view, which displays some portion of the underlying data and interacts
with the user

- A controller, which mediates between the model and the view and manages
the notifications of state changes
